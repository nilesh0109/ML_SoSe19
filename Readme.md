This repo contains the assignments from Machine Learning class from Professor Cetina (summer term 2019).

# Machine Learning

###### Assignment 1:
Modeling noisy sine wave using  third degree polynomial linear regression and training the model using stochatic gradient descend.

###### Assignment 2:
Modeling the linear classifier using logistic regression and training using stochatic gradient descend.

###### Assignment 3:
Using Gaussian Discrimination Analysis(GDA) to model the classifier for chagas paracite diagnosis. The training data is 30 positive and 30 negative examples.

###### Assignment 4:
Classifying the same chagas paracite samples used in exercise 3, using Support Vector Machines(SVM).

###### Assignment 5:
Implementation of Adaboost for classifying very noisy data by combining several weak classifiers

###### Assignment 6:
Implemenation of Expectation-Maximization(EM) for Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) for clustering the data coming from 3 gaussian models.(Partially Done)

###### Assignment 7:
Implemention of 10-arms bandit problem using epsilon-greedy policy and comparison of various epsilon values.
Also, comparison of e-greedy with or w/o Upper Confidance Boundary(UCB). An optimisitic uniform initialization is also explored.

###### Assignment 8:
Iterative policy evaluation using Dynamic programing(DP) for random policy. Solved the grid world problem mentioned in sutton and Batro at page 76.

# Language Technology

###### Assignment 10:
Implementaion of pageRank algorithm using matrix formula and iterative method both.

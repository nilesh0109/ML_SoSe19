This repo contains the assignments from Machine Learning class from Professor Cetina (summer term 2019).

# Machine Learning

### [Assignment 1](https://github.com/nilesh0109/ML_SoSe19/blob/master/ML_ex1.ipynb):
Modeling noisy sine wave using  third degree polynomial linear regression and training the model using stochatic gradient descend.


### [Assignment 2](https://github.com/nilesh0109/ML_SoSe19/blob/master/ML_ex2.ipynb):
Modeling the linear classifier using logistic regression and training using stochatic gradient descend.


### [Assignment 3](https://github.com/nilesh0109/ML_SoSe19/blob/master/ML_ex3.ipynb):
Using Gaussian Discrimination Analysis(GDA) to model the classifier for chagas paracite diagnosis. The training data is 30 positive and 30 negative examples.


### [Assignment 4](https://github.com/nilesh0109/ML_SoSe19/blob/master/ML_ex04.ipynb):
Classifying the same chagas paracite samples used in exercise 3, using Support Vector Machines(SVM).


### [Assignment 5](https://github.com/nilesh0109/ML_SoSe19/blob/master/ML_ex05.ipynb):
Implementation of Adaboost for classifying very noisy data by combining several weak classifiers


### [Assignment 6](https://github.com/nilesh0109/ML_SoSe19/blob/master/ML_ex06.ipynb):
Implemenation of Expectation-Maximization(EM) for Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) for clustering the data coming from 3 gaussian models.(Partially Done)


### [Assignment 7](https://github.com/nilesh0109/ML_SoSe19/blob/master/ML_ex07_UCB.ipynb):
Implemention of 10-arms bandit problem using epsilon-greedy policy and comparison of various epsilon values.
Also, comparison of e-greedy with or w/o Upper Confidance Boundary(UCB). An optimisitic uniform initialization is also explored.


### [Assignment 8](https://github.com/nilesh0109/ML_SoSe19/blob/master/Ex08.ipynb):
Iterative policy evaluation using Dynamic programing(DP) for random policy. Solved the grid world problem mentioned in sutton and Batro at page 76.

# Language Technology

### [Assignment 3](https://github.com/nilesh0109/ML_SoSe19/blob/master/LT/LT_assignment3.py):
Finding most frenquent unigram, bigram, trigram in the given training corpora.

### [Assignment 10](https://github.com/nilesh0109/ML_SoSe19/blob/master/LT_assignment10.ipynb):
Implementaion of pageRank algorithm using matrix formula and iterative method both.
